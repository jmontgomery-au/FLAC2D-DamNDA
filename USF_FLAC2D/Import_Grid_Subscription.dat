;Model Setup
; This model will require dynamic, fluid-mechanical coupling, and user-defined models (but this is now enabled by default
model configure dynamic 
model configure fluid-flow
; Fluid calculations currently require this to be off
zone nodal-mixed-discretization off
;
;Set unsaturated solution process with a zero tensile strength in water
zone fluid unsaturated cutoff 0
;
;Initialization will be performed for static conditions and mechanical only
model fluid active off
model dyn active off
model mech active on
; Use small strain for initialization
model large-strain off
; Set gravity to value in SetConstants
model gravity [_grav] ; m/s^2
; Import grid file with names for groups and faces
zone import 'USF_Geom.f2grid' use-given-ids
model save 'USF_Geom_Subscription'
